1. Overview:
The crypto web application is a platform that provides users with real-time information about cryptocurrencies. It allows users to view the latest prices, market data, and other relevant information about various cryptocurrencies. The application will be built using React.js for the front-end, Chakra UI for the user interface components, Axios for making API requests, and CoinGecko API for retrieving crypto-related data.

2. System Architecture:
The crypto web application will follow a client-server architecture, where the client-side will be implemented using React.js and Chakra UI, and the server-side will be responsible for making API requests to the CoinGecko API.

- Client-Side: The client-side will handle the user interface, user interactions, and communication with the server-side.
   - React Components: Chakra UI components will be utilized to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface.
   - Data Fetching: Axios will be used to make API requests to the server-side and retrieve data from the CoinGecko API.
   - State Management: React's state and context will be used to manage and update the application's state, such as the selected cryptocurrency, user preferences, and fetched data.

- Server-Side: The server-side will handle API requests to the CoinGecko API and act as an intermediary between the client-side and the API.
   - Express.js: The server will utilize the Express.js framework to handle HTTP requests and responses.
   - Proxy API: The server will act as a proxy between the client-side and the CoinGecko API, forwarding requests and returning responses to the client-side.

3. User Interface:
The client-side React application will provide a visually appealing and intuitive user interface using Chakra UI components. The following features will be included:
   - Cryptocurrency List: Users can view a list of popular cryptocurrencies, including their names, symbols, prices, and percentage changes.
   - Detailed Cryptocurrency View: Users can click on a specific cryptocurrency to view more detailed information, such as market cap, volume, and price charts.
   - Search Functionality: Users can search for specific cryptocurrencies using their names or symbols, filtering the displayed list based on their search query.
   - Theme Customization: The application can support theme customization, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes.

4. Data Retrieval:
The server-side will use Axios to make API requests to the CoinGecko API and retrieve real-time cryptocurrency data. The following functionalities will be included:
   - Cryptocurrency Prices: The server will retrieve the latest prices of cryptocurrencies from the CoinGecko API and return them to the client-side for display.
   - Market Data: The server can fetch additional market data, such as market cap, volume, and percentage changes, to provide users with comprehensive information about each cryptocurrency.
   - Historical Data: The server can fetch historical price data for cryptocurrencies, allowing users to view price trends and perform analysis.

5. Error Handling and Loading States:
The application will handle error scenarios and loading states to provide a seamless user experience. The following features will be included:
   - Error Handling: The application will display appropriate error messages and notifications in case of API request failures or other errors.
   - Loading States: The application will display loading indicators or placeholders while waiting for API responses to ensure a smooth user experience during data retrieval.

6. User Preferences and Settings:
The application can allow users to customize their preferences and settings. The following functionalities can be included:
   - Currency Selection: Users can choose their preferred currency to display cryptocurrency prices and market data.
   - Price Alerts: Users can set price alerts for specific cryptocurrencies and receive notifications when the prices reach their defined
